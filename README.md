CUAHSI.Apps
===========

CUAHSI.Apps is a platform for creating decision support and data visualization tools connected to CUAHSI data services.

CUAHSI.Apps consists of:

CUAHSI.Browser, an HTML5 + JS + CSS + IndexedDB two-tab browser application that combines a pre-built user interface for finding and downloading hydrologic data from CUAHSI data services, with a flexible data visualization page capable of rendering downloaded data. The data visualization page and local database can be extended into a browser-based decision support system (DSS) that can use real-world public hydrologic data without making any network requests - data a user downloads is already inside the in-browser IndexedDB database. This project is configured to run inside the Windows Azure live and local emulation environments. This means that with the required programs installed on your computer, you can begin prototyping a working decision support system built out of HTML, JS, and CSS. Later, if you decide to host your application, you can replace settings with information from your account, and deploy to your own cloud system.
